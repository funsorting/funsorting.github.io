### v1.3.3 (2017-05-19):

Fixes incorrect timer clearing. (Thanks, @dmeiz1)

### v1.3.2 (2017-05-11):

Fix for calling clearTimeout in IE 8. (Thanks, @prchaoz!)

Additional updates to peerDependencies around the new React 15.5-compatible
libraries. (Thanks, @MichaelDeBoey!)

### v1.3.1 (2017-05-09):

Fixes React peer dependencies to specify versions that work with
`prop-types`. (Thanks, @MichaelDeBoey!)

### v1.3.0 (2017-05-08):

Removes warnings from React 15.5 for React 16.0 compatibility.

Converts to ES2015 classes, adds compilation on distribution.

Minor version bump due to changes around removal of isMounted checks, so there
may be some regressions.

### v1.2.2 (2017-04-19):

Adds `interruptBehavior` prop to `VelocityComponent`. (Thanks, @Robinfr!)

Changes to remove warnings in React 15.5 will come shortly in v1.3.

### v1.2.1 (2017-01-19):

This is a minor version bump that updates the version of babel to the latest (v6).

### v1.2.0 (2017-01-12):

This is a minor version bump due to the `velocity-animate` dependency getting a minor version
bump to 1.4 that may contain timing changes. See `velocity-animate` changes here:

https://github.com/julianshapiro/velocity/compare/1.3.0...1.4.0

Thanks to @matthewjf for helping track this down as an issue with how Velocity before 1.4
fired `complete` callbacks on multiple elements animating.

#### Bug fixes:
 * Check for presence of `navigator` before using it to determine if we’re running
   in a browser. (Thanks, @alampros!)
 * Fix undefined `forEach` method call when doing recursive cache-cleaning without
   jQuery. (Thanks, @kennygwang!)

### v1.1.11 (2016-10-20):

Bump `velocity-animate` to v1.3.1 once more now that it's published to npm!

### v1.1.10 (2016-10-17):

### v1.1.5 (2016-04-11):

Updates to allow React 15. (Thanks, @StevenLangbroek!)

 * Passes context into VelocityTransitionGroup animations' “complete” callbacks
   so that they know what elements finished animating.


### v1.1.4 (2016-03-09):

### v1.1.3 (2016-02-16):

### v1.1.2 (2016-02-08):

#### Bug fixes
 * `complete` callbacks for `VelocityTransitionGroup` now fire correctly.
 * `velocityHelpers`’s `registerEffect` can be called (as a no-op) on the server.
 * Fallback to `setTimeout` if `requestAnimationFrame` is not defined.

#### Features
 * `VelocityTransitionGroup` can take `enterHideStyle` and `enterShowStyle` props
   to customize how entering elements are kept from being shown before their
   animations start.


### v1.1.1 (2015-10-21):

#### Bug fixes
 * Fix for `VelocityTransitionGroup` not animating when no `leave` prop is set.
