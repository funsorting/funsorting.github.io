### Installation

First Install npm modules in the root module:

> Make sure, you are using NPM3.

```bash
cd ../
npm install
cd ./example
```

Then install NPM modules for this example app:

```bash
npm install
```

### Running the App

Run the app with `npm start`. Then you'll be able to a cess the app via <http://localhost:9999>.

Once you made a change to the example app or in the root module, the client app will reload again.

> This reload is a full reload but not HMR based hot reloading.
