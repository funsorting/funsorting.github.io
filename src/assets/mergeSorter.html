<h1>Merge Sort</h1>
<div>
  Conceptually, a merge sort works as follows:
  <br/>
  -Divide the unsorted list into n sublists, each containing 1 element (a list of 1 element is considered sorted).
  <br/>
  -Repeatedly merge sublists to produce new sorted sublists until there is only 1 sublist remaining. This will be the sorted list.
</div>
